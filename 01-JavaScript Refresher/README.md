# Understanding Important Concepts of JavaScript
## Day 1: 17/11/2022
### Intro 
- JS stands for JavaScript. 
- It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. 
- It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it
### Syntax 
- We can place js script in head, body or in external files with .js extension <br>
```jsx
  <script> 
    // JavaScript Code <br />
  </script> 
```
### Variables
- Variables in JavaScript are used to store values, such as numbers, strings, arrays, and objects.
- JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
#### var
- The var keyword is used to declare a variable with function scope, meaning the variable is accessible within the function in which it is declared and in any nested functions.
#### Let 
- Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
- Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.
- Variables defined with let have Block Scope.
#### Const 
- Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.
- Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
- Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
- Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
### JS Functions 
- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
- **Syntax:** 
```jsx
  function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
```
#### Arrow Function 
- Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:
-  Syntax: <br>

- If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword: <br>
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/202526295-235084bc-97f8-4456-8bf0-286c5b4dcc5f.png)
- **Note:** This works only if the function has only one statement.
- **Important:**
- When having no arguments, you have to use empty parentheses in the function declaration: <br>

- When having exactly one argument, you may omit the parentheses: <br>

### JS Modules 
- JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.
- This makes it easier to maintain the code-base.
- JavaScript modules rely on the import and export statements.
- Modules only work with the HTTP(s) protocol.
- A web-page opened via the file:// protocol cannot use import / export.
#### Export
- You can export a function or variable from any file.
- There are two types of exports: Named and Default. <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/202528266-a8dbe9c9-4e2b-4e7a-beaf-7908f223c1f2.png)
- A file can only contain one default and an unlimited amount of named exports.
#### Import
- You can import modules into a file in two ways, based on if they are named exports or default exports.
- Named exports are constructed using curly braces. Default exports are not. <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/202528332-8ca703dd-4626-43db-bd48-be415c58e98c.png)
- When importing named exports, you can also import all named exports at once with the following syntax:
```jsx
   import * as upToYou from './path/to/file.js;
```   
## Day 2: 18/11/2022
### Classes
- Classes are blueprints / templates for objects.
- You can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. 
- It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. 
- Based on these descriptions, you build the house. House is the object.
- Syntax: <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/202755105-6cca8ade-9be7-4d64-932c-3aab17ddb6bf.png)
- Example:  <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/202755223-01ddcaf8-b51f-457c-8594-9824405bc348.png)
- Classes can have methods as well. 
- Methods are simply functions attached to classes.
- Constructor is used to initialize object properties
#### Creating Objects

#### Class Inheritance
- Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.
- Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class. <br>

#### Methods and Constructor in ES6 and ES7

### Spread and Rest Operator 
- The spread operator is extremely useful for cloning arrays and objects.Since both are reference types (and not primitives), copying them safely (i.e. preventing future mutation of the copied original)can be tricky. 
- With the spread operator you have an easy way of creating a (shallow!) clone of the object or array.

### Destructuring 
- The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
- **Example:**  <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/202774566-053f6478-075f-4bc6-a877-6511fdfc54a5.png)
## Day 3: 19/11/2022
### Primitive Data Types 
- In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. 
- There are 7 primitive data types:
  - string
  - number
  - bigint
  - boolean
  - undefined
  - symbol
  - null
- A primitive data type in JavaScript, it is stored on a stack. 
- A primitive data type on the stack is identified by the variable name you used for declaration in your program. With each primitive data type you create, data is added to the stack.
- **Example:** 
- Declare a variable named "num1" and assign value of 1 to it.
- Let's declare another variable named "num2" and assign "num1" to it, so now num2= 1 as well. 
- So both variables have the same value.
- What happens on the stack is that, the computer creates room for num1 and stores its assigned value on the stack. 
- When num2 is created, the computer again creates room, and stores 1 on the stack. 
- It does not matter that both variables are assigned the same value.
- **What if during the coding process, we decided to update the value of num1 to say, 100? Does it mean num2 will change too? The answer is no.**
- Since num1 and num2 were stored differently on the stack, updating one of them will not affect the other
- So, in effect, the two variables have no relationship to each other. It means primitive data types do not point to any other variable rather just copy their content, if assigned. 
- **Code:** <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/202848542-196044b4-a8ec-4269-b754-c9598c3324e0.png)
### Reference Data Types
- Reference data types are dynamic in nature. That is, they do not have a fixed size.
- Most of them are considered as objects, and therefore have methods. 
- Examples of such data types include arrays, functions, collections, and all other types of objects.
- The difference comes in when the computer has to store a reference data type. 
- When you create a variable and assign it a value that is a reference data type, the computer does not directly store that data type in that variable (as is the case with primitive types).
- What you have assigned to that variable is a pointer that points to the location of that data type in memory.
- Code: <br>

### Arrays 
- An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value. <br>

## Day 3: 21/11/2022
### Callbacks 
- A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
- This technique allows a function to call another function.
- A callback function can run after another function has finished.  <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/203042693-55ede3e7-6970-4b96-82ed-0721f441a5b8.png)
#### Need of callbacks 
- Callbacks functions are used to acquire control over the sequence of execution. 
- Generally, functions are executed on the basis of the sequence that they are invoked, not on the sequence in which they are defined
- A callback's primary purpose is to execute code in response to an event. 
- These events might be user-initiated, such as mouse clicks or typing. 
- With a callback, you may instruct your application to "execute this code every time the user clicks a key on the keyboard."
- The benefit of using a callback function is that you can wait for the result of a previous function call and then execute another function call. 
- Example: <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/203046443-66a5889f-3891-4b1a-9e09-0b15b31819a3.png)
- Here, the greet() function is called after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). 
- During this wait, the sayName('John'); is executed. 
- That is why Hello John is printed before Hello world.
- The above code is executed asynchronously (the second function; sayName() does not wait for the first function; greet() to complete).
- However, if you want to wait for the result of the previous function call before the next statement is executed, you can use a callback function.
- Example: <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/203046691-de6c60a8-9be8-4673-a3cf-72c3190a5fbe.png)
- In the above program, the code is executed synchronously. The sayName() function is passed as an argument to the greet() function.
- The setTimeout() method executes the greet() function only after 2 seconds. 
- However, the sayName() function waits for the execution of the greet() function.
#### Synchronous VS Asynchronous in JS 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/203052065-288d4ea8-0990-49c6-9884-898144725dfc.png) <BR>
- With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other tasks in parallell.
- But, asynchronus programmes are difficult to write and difficult to debug.
- Because of this, most modern asynchronous JavaScript methods don't use callbacks. 
- Having multiple callbacks in the code increases the complexity of the code in terms of readability, executability, and many other terms.
- This excessive nesting of callbacks is often termed Callback Hell. 
- Instead, in JavaScript, asynchronous programming is solved using Promises instead.
### Promises in JS
- In JavaScript, a promise is a good way to handle asynchronous operations. It is used to find out if the asynchronous operation is successfully completed or not.
- A promise may have one of three states.
  - Pending 
  - Fulfilled
  - Rejected
- A promise starts in a pending state. That means the process is not complete. 
- If the operation is successful, the process ends in a fulfilled state. 
- And, if an error occurs, the process ends in a rejected state.
- **Syntax:** let promise = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {....});
  - To create a promise object, we use the Promise() constructor.
  - The Promise() constructor takes a function as an argument. The function also accepts two functions resolve() and reject().
  - If the promise returns successfully, the resolve() function is called. And, if an error occurs, the reject() function is called.
- Example: <br>
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/203062138-0c30d04a-9aef-4d08-9dad-98ef21b3cfc4.png)<br>
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/203062206-a3c5ca24-a086-419b-b1d3-cfb1515860a1.png)
- The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.
  - While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.
  - When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
  - When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.
#### then(), catch(), and final ()
- Promises have the then, catch and finally methods for doing different things depending on the outcome of a promise, or to use the promise object. 
  - then: when a promise is successful, you can then use the resolved data
  - catch: when a promise fails, you catch the error, and do something with the error information
  - finally: when a promise settles (fails or passes), you can finally do something
##### then()
- Invoked when a promise is kept or broken. 
- It can be chained to handle the fulfillment or rejection of a promise. 
- It takes in two functions as parameters. 
- The first one is invoked if the promise is fulfilled and the second one(optional) is invoked if the promise is rejected. 
- Example: <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/203069318-291c20b6-e4a7-43a0-868e-9169f5cd9777.png)
#### catch()
- catch() can be used for handling the errors(if any). 
- It takes only one function as a parameter which is used to handle the errors (if any). 
- Example: <br>
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/203070687-db25e155-0309-4786-a217-085d0136f6db.png)
### async()
- We use the async keyword with a function to represent that the function is an asynchronous function. 
- The async function returns a promise. <br>
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/203075626-fc77b1b1-9187-4b19-8069-74d623a2efd1.png)
### await()
- The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.
- The await keyword makes the function pause the execution and wait for a resolved/rejected promise before it continues
- The async function allows the asynchronous method to be executed in a seemingly synchronous way. 
- Though the operation is asynchronous, it seems that the operation is executed in synchronous manner.
- Example: <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88162824/203078083-38192003-0f0f-49f8-a755-52e32ca6b517.png)
