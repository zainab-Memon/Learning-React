# What is an API?
- An API (Application Programming Interface) allows your application to interact with an external service using a simple set of commands. 
- To break down the name, the “Interface” is where different software components can interact. 
- Using an API allows developers to add specific functionalities to their applications and can speed up the development process.
- There are APIs for nearly every category imaginable from data to travel and even sports. 
- For example, rather than investing time and resources to create their own payment processing system, many applications use a payment processing API instead.
