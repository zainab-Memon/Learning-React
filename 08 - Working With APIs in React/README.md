# What is an API?
- An API (Application Programming Interface) allows your application to interact with an external service using a simple set of commands. 
- To break down the name, the “Interface” is where different software components can interact. 
- Using an API allows developers to add specific functionalities to their applications and can speed up the development process.
- There are APIs for nearly every category imaginable from data to travel and even sports. 
- For example, rather than investing time and resources to create their own payment processing system, many applications use a payment processing API instead.

# Types of APIs
- There are several types of APIs, including:
## Open APIs: 
- Also known as external or public APIs, these are available to developers and other users with minimal restrictions. They may require registration, app approval, or an API key.
## Internal APIs: 
- These are hidden from external users and are meant to be used inside an organization. They allow for communication between different internal systems and services.
## Partner APIs: 
- These are similar to internal APIs, but are shared between organizations in a business partnership.
## Composite APIs: 
- These allow for multiple endpoints to be accessed with a single API call.
## REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs: 
- These use HTTP requests to POST (create), PUT (update), GET (read), and DELETE (delete) data.
## SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) APIs: 
- These use XML as a format to transmit data, and are well-suited for large complex systems.
## RPC (Remote Procedure Call) APIs: 
- These allow for communication between a client and a server, and are typically used for small, simple systems.
